A game engine for creating small games that runs on web browsers. Based on p5.js

!! Under Blazing Construction !!

== Dependencies
* node.js (I use node.js 11.x. Other versions may still work.)
* npm
* make
* A web browser with JavaScript enabled.

== How To
[source,sh]
----
git clone <URL of this repo>
npm i

# Something special is yet to done. There is only some piece of quickstart program.
your_favorite_editor src/main.ts
make

# Visit dist/index.html to view the result.

== Troubleshooting
=== `npx: command not found` error
On some environment, the command `npx` is not available because node.js' version is too old or whatever reasons.

If so, in `Makefile` in the repository root, replace
[source,sh]
----
npx webpack
....
npx tslinter 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
npx jest
----
with
[source,sh]
----
node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
....
node_modules/tslinter/bin/tslinter 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
node node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js
----
to get `make` and `make test` to work.
